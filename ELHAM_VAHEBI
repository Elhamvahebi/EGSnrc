hello 
i have questions about EGSnrc . 
Please help me 
I put a plan TBI and opened a 40 x 40
percent field. Because the patient is TBI, I
put it in ssd 200, and the field size is about
80 Ã— 80. But when we irradiate the
phantom with the same conditions,
unfortunately the phantom does not take a
dose. Shows only green and blue doses, ie
50% doses. And does not show high doses
and 100% doses. I do not know exactly
where I am wrong and what circumstances
I have not considered. Please help me or
introduce me to someone to help me.
thanks a lot
